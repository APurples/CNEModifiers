# Modifiers for Codename Engine!

This is an addon for Codename Engine that adds modifiers to spice up the game!

Modders are allowed to add the modifiers to their own mod as long as they credit me.

## Installation Guide

### For Mods folder
1. Extract the files in the mods folder
2. Enjoy !!

### For Addons folder
1. If not done already, make a folder called "addons" (without the quotes)
2. Extract the files in the addons folder

Quick note: If this is being used as an addon, this has the potential to break mods and override the options menu. So use this at your own caution.
